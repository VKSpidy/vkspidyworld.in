    <P><strong>TheÂ Stone AgeÂ </strong>was a broadÂ <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory" style="">prehistoric</a>Â period during whichÂ stoneÂ was widely used to make tools with an edge, a point, or a percussion surface. The period lasted for roughly 3.4 million years,Â and ended between 8700 BCE and 2000 BCE ,Â with the advent of metalworking.</P>

   <strong> TheÂ Bronze AgeÂ </strong>is a historicalÂ <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodization">period</a>Â that was characterized by the use ofÂ bronze, in some areasÂ proto-writing, and other early features of urbanÂ civilization. The Bronze Age is the second principal period of theÂ three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system, as proposed in modern times byÂ Christian JÃ¼rgensen Thomsen, for classifying and studying ancient societies.

    <strong> Latitude</strong> is a way of measuring your position on the earth in a north to south direction. It is measured in degrees, with the equator representing 0Â°, and the poles representing 90Â°. For example, New York is at a latitude of 41Â° north. Latitudes in the southern hemisphere are measured in degrees south.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude"><mark style="background-color:white;">In Detail...ðŸ‘ˆ</mark></a><br>

  <p style="font-size:2rem;"> Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value.

    <li><b> Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/artificial-intelligence-tutorial/what-is-artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in recent years, but it continues to be a trend to watch because its effects on how we live, work, and play are only in the early stages. <br>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSWL7B0507WuZ_VTpJMHQT1fWxSVL8k23-x-w&usqp=CAU">In addition, other branches of AI have developed, including Machine Learning, which we will go into below. AI refers to computer systems built to mimic human intelligence and perform tasks such as recognition of images, speech or patterns, and decision making. AI can do these tasks faster and more accurately than humans.
     
      
      </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/what-is-machine-learning"><b>Machine Learning</b></a> is a subset of AI. With Machine Learning, computers are programmed to learn to do something they are not programmed to do: they learn by discovering patterns and insights from data. In general, we have two types of learning, supervised and unsupervised.

While Machine Learning is a subset of AI, we also have subsets within the domain of Machine Learning, including neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning. Each of these subsets offers an opportunity for specializing in a career field that will only grow.

      <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.simplilearn.com/top-technology-trends-and-jobs-article/amp"><b>Robotic Process Automation or RPA</b></a>
Like AI and Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation, or RPA, is another technology that is automating jobs. RPA is the use of software to automate business processes such as interpreting applications, processing transactions, dealing with data, and even replying to emails. RPA automates repetitive tasks that people used to do. These are not just the menial tasks of a low-paid worker: up to 45 percent of the activities we do can be automated, including the work of financial managers, doctors, and CEOs.

    <li>
      <a href=""></a><b>Edge Computing</b>
Formerly a technology trend to watch, cloud computing has become mainstream, with major players AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud dominating the market. The adoption of cloud computing is still growing, as more and more businesses migrate to a cloud solution. But itâ€™s no longer the emerging technology.
      
      </li>
    <li>
    <b>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality</b>
Virtual Reality (VR) immerses the user in an environment while Augment Reality (AR) enhances their environment. Although VR has primarily been used for gaming thus far, it has also been used for training, as with VirtualShip, a simulation software used to train U.S. Navy, Army, and Coast Guard ship captains. The popular Pokemon Go is an example of AR.
